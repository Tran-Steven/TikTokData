# TikTok Data DM

Import your TikTok JSON Data and display your DM Conversations in a TikTok like UI.

Currently TikTok's data is missing some information. When you send a TikTok along with a message, it only contains the TikTok message, but not the TikTok video attached. So some of your DM conversations may look odd. This is the reason and there's no real fix unless TikTok updates what is in their JSON Data.

## Privacy

No data is collected, and everything is stored locally. The website takes in the JSON file and parses out the conversations to display the information.
