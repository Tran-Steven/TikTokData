# TikTok Data DM

Import your TikTok JSON Data and display your DM Conversations in a TikTok-like UI.

Once you have your data JSON file, simply input the file into the app.
# How To Use

Please follow [TikTok's Guide](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/personalized-ads-and-data/requesting-your-data) on how to request your data and make sure to select the JSON option.

## Data Limitations

TikTok's exported data has some constraints. When a TikTok video is shared in a DM, the JSON file only contains the message text, not the attached video. As a result, some conversations may appear incomplete or out of context. This is due to TikTok’s data structure, and there is no fix unless TikTok includes this information in future exports.

## Privacy

Your data is **never** collected. Everything is processed and stored locally on your device. The website simply parses the imported JSON file and formats the conversations for display—nothing is uploaded or shared.
